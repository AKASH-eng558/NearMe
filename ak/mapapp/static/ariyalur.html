                Ariyalur is a historically rich and geologically significant town located in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. Known for its ancient temples and cultural heritage, the region was once ruled by the Cholas, Pallavas, Nayaks, and later the British. One of its most remarkable features is its unique geologyâ€”Ariyalur is famous for its limestone deposits and ancient fossils, including those from the Cretaceous period, making it a treasure trove for geologists and paleontologists. The local economy thrives on cement industries due to the abundance of limestone, alongside agriculture, with crops like paddy, sugarcane, and groundnut being commonly grown.
